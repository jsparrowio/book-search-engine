## Description
  
The Book Search Engine is a simple React/node/express/mongoDB/Apollo/GraphQL web application that utilizes the Google Books API to allow a user to search, save, and explore books. It features a user sign up/login, and a personalized dashboard to allow a user to view and delete saved books.

This project was already fully written and functional, but was utilizing REST APIs to make its database calls. The project was then converted to use Apollo/GraphQL to make its database calls, which is how this deployed application runs.
